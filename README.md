Welcome to my super cool weather App!

Everyone has need for checking the weather! Maybe you have a sports game to play, or a picnic to enjoy. Don't get rained out! check the app!

Simply type in the name of a city you want to see, and boom! You have the current weather!

This app was built with Python, Flask, React, postgres, and SQLAlchemy. Planned to deploy using heroku, but it isn't free anymore :(

PLANNED FUNCTIONALITY
-The app needs delete functionality
-Check for invalid and duplicate cities
-Find way to delpoy
